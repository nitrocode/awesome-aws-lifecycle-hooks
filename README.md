# awesome-aws-lifecycle-hooks

I was learning about lifecycle hooks recently. Before I added my own, I thought I'd do some research in the lifecycle hooks available. I was hoping to find a simple terraform module lambda for ECS. After some searching, I curated this list and thought "Why not another awesome list?" And the list was born.

Feel free to contribute.

## Hooks

### ECS

* [aws-samples/ecs-cid-sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-cid-sample) - Drain using cloudwatch event, sns, and python lambda. Deploy with cloudformation.
* [getsocial-rnd/ecs-drain-lambda](https://github.com/getsocial-rnd/ecs-drain-lambda) - Drain using cloudwatch event and golang lambda. Deploy with sls.
* [terraform-community-modules/tf_aws_ecs_instance_draining_on_scale_in](https://github.com/terraform-community-modules/tf_aws_ecs_instance_draining_on_scale_in)
* [ktruckenmiller/aws-ecs-spot-instance-drainer](https://github.com/ktruckenmiller/aws-ecs-spot-instance-drainer)
* [blinkist/terraform-aws-airship-ecs-instance-draining](https://github.com/blinkist/terraform-aws-airship-ecs-instance-draining) - Drain using cloudwatch event, sns, and python lambda. Deploy lambda with terraform.
* [btisdall/ecs-cid](https://github.com/btisdall/ecs-cid)
* [docker-production-aws/lambda-lifecycle-hooks](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/lambda-lifecycle-hooks/tree/final)
* [ericdahl/tf-ecs](https://github.com/ericdahl/tf-ecs) - Drain using cloudwatch event, sns, and python lambda. Deploy with terraform.
* [claranet/terraform-aws-ecs-container-instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-aws-ecs-container-instances) - Drain using cloudwatch event, sqs, and python lambda. Deploy with terraform.

### EKS

* [aws-samples/amazon-k8s-node-drainer](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-k8s-node-drainer)
* [keikoproj/lifecycle-manager](https://github.com/keikoproj/lifecycle-manager)

### Backup

* [aws-samples/aws-lambda-lifecycle-hooks-function](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-lifecycle-hooks-function) - backup data to s3 using sns and lambda

## Invocation conditions

| Condition                       | Invoked? |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Spot interruption               | Yes |
| EC2 instance degradation        | Yes |
| ASG instance refresh            | Yes |
| ASG max instance lifetime       | Yes |
| [EC2 manual termination from CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group.html) | Yes |
| EC2 manual termination from UI  | No |

## Testing

```bash
# set variables
INSTANCE_ID=i-aaaabbbbcccc
ASG_NAME=asg-xyz
LIFECYCLE_HOOK_NAME=lifecycle-xyz

# terminate a specific instance id
aws autoscaling \
  terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group \
  --should-decrement-desired-capacity \
  --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID

# once the instance is in a Terminating:Wait stage, continue the lifecycle
aws autoscaling \
  complete-lifecycle-action \
  --lifecycle-action-result CONTINUE \
  --lifecycle-hook-name $LIFECYCLE_HOOK_NAME \
  --auto-scaling-group-name $ASG_NAME \
  --instance-id $INSTANCE_ID
```
